# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [X] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
    
    I have met this requirement, within my directory(lib), I have a file called CLI.rb that acts as a controller for the "recipe_generator" gem.
- [X] Pull data from an external source

  The data/website I scraped from in this case was www.bbcgoodfood.com and it's sub links.
  
- [X] Implement both list and detail views
  My list view would be my print_options method within my CLI file. The detail view is my #general method which contains the "core." This     includes recipe ingredients and instructions.
